#Multi Language Website

This is an example of how to use Gettext with PHP. In this example we use the
**php-gettext** plugin that can be found [here][1].

With a simple "Hello World!", you can see how Gettext works with PHP.
If you will run the code, try put "/?lang=fr_FR" on the end of the url.

There are available some languages:

+ en_GB
+ es
+ fr_FR
+ ja_JP
+ pt_BR
+ pt_PT
+ zh_Hans
